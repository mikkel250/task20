// TODO:
// might be easier to put two buttons with trash and pencil icons next to tasks. Or 3...a checkmark icon or suchlike.

// Todo: 
// Need to figure out how to get the axios delete to work correctly

// dealing with axios handy guide:

// to change the app completely (following the robofriends model), need to move the fetch out of the ShowAllTasks and into the App.js and then pass the tasks into the ShowAllTasks


// On the edit page, can just use the ID to do the FindOne and then onClick=findOneAndUpdate.
// Use the same form as the Add page, but when the button is clicked, take them back to the tasks page (or add a second button for "Save & Done")
// The other option would be to try to transform a specific 'card' from listing the data to being a form...but this would probably be more trouble than it's worth
